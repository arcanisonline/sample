    <details>
        <summary>My Childhood</summary>
        <p>I grew up in a small town on Lake Como - Italy. As a child I was quite good at school and my interests started to grow. In fact, I started playing trumpet in middle school and I was also attracted by computer games and computers in general; however it wasn't untill recent years that I discover my passion for Computer Science as a subject.</p>

        <summary>My Formal Education</summary>
        <p>As I said before, I discoverd my interest in Computer Science as a subject only in recent years and my formal education was quite far from it. In fact, during highschool, I studied trumpet with a private teacher and I took formal exams and assessments in Como - Italy. However I managed to graduate in music only later for a couple of reasons: I started having embouchure problems that took years to solve and my interests deviated toward Physics. After highschool, in fact, I studied Physics in Milan - Italy, graduating with full grades. Finally, two years later, I graduated in music, having found again my passion for trumpet playing.</p>

        <summary>Computer Science</summary>
        <p>Computer science is one of my main interests and I would like to integrate it in my profession. My main area of interest is Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, but I recently decided to learn more about web design and development, so I started this website for learning purposes.</p>

        <summary>Music</summary>
        <p>Since graduation, I started playing and teaching trumpet as a semi-professional. I play in local wind bands and, sometimes in local orchestras. Moreover, I recently grew an interest for piano playing. In fact, I'm currently taking piano lessons once a week. </p>
